
# ARCHITECTURE.md

This document defines exactly how the AI Database Administrator project is structured and how every component connects. It is built directly on top of `TECHSTACK.md` and the four feature specs (Root Cause Diagnosis, Safe Simulation & Verification Sandbox, Predictive ML + Closed-Loop Optimization, Cost-to-Dollar ROI). No component below is invented beyond what those documents require.

---

## 1. System Architecture

The system has one **application database** (its own metadata/experiment store) and zero or more **connected customer databases** (the Postgres instances being monitored, which may be Neon, RDS, Supabase, or self-hosted). The backend never writes to a customer database except through the guarded Feature 2 deployment path (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `ANALYZE`), and only after policy-engine approval.

```

### Request Flow

```text
Browser → Next.js page → API client (fetch + TanStack Query)
        → FastAPI route → auth dependency → service function
        → (service calls agent / ML / deterministic engine as needed)
        → service persists/reads via SQLAlchemy/asyncpg
        → JSON response → TanStack Query cache → UI re-render
```

### Data Flow

```text
Customer Postgres (pg_stat_statements, pg_stat_activity, pg_locks, EXPLAIN, ...)
   → Telemetry Collector worker (polling, asyncpg)
   → Application Database (normalized evidence tables)
   → Feature engineering (Pandas/Polars)
   → ML models (score/predict) + Deterministic evidence engine
   → Agents (interpret, reconcile, decide)
   → API response → Frontend
```

### Agent Flow

```text
Trigger (new telemetry batch / user-initiated diagnosis / scheduled forecast)
   → Orchestrating service builds a structured evidence payload
   → LangGraph graph invoked with that payload
   → Specialist agents run (each calls only its own tools)
   → Supervisor/Policy agent reconciles outputs
   → Structured result (JSON) returned to the service layer
   → Persisted to Application Database + returned to frontend
```

Agents are **never** given raw database credentials or unrestricted SQL execution — they call typed Python tool functions (in `app/tools/`) which enforce read-only access or a fixed set of approved DDL/DML statements.

### Database Flow

* **Application Database** (PostgreSQL/Neon): stores users, connected-database credentials (encrypted), telemetry history, evidence graphs, experiments, model metadata, forecasts, bandit state, ROI records.
* **Customer Database** (Postgres, any provider): read via system views/`EXPLAIN` for Features 1 and 3; read/write via HypoPG (session-local, non-persistent) and shadow-clone databases for Feature 2; a narrow, policy-approved write path for canary deployment (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `ANALYZE`).
* **Shadow Databases** (ephemeral Docker Postgres containers): created per experiment, cloned from the customer database via `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`, destroyed after the experiment completes.

### Recommendation and Experiment Data Contract

Recommendations and experiments are separate persisted workflows:

```text
Live diagnosis + telemetry
  -> deterministic recommendation candidate
  -> owned customer connection + pg_stat_statements workload
  -> ephemeral Docker shadow clone
  -> baseline replay -> candidate installation -> candidate replay
  -> paired verification and policy verdict
  -> human approval -> guarded canary
```

The recommendation API (`GET /api/v1/diagnostics/recommendations` and
`GET /api/v1/diagnoses/{id}/recommendations`) never creates browser-side
placeholder candidates. It returns candidates derived from persisted diagnosis
evidence and includes the exact candidate SQL, owning connection, diagnosis,
and any linked experiment ID.

The simulation API requires the recommendation's connection and diagnosis IDs.
It decrypts the customer DSN only on the backend, obtains parameter-free
read-only queries from `pg_stat_statements`, provisions a temporary Docker
PostgreSQL container, restores the customer database with `pg_dump`/
`pg_restore`, and removes the container in a `finally` block. Docker, the
PostgreSQL client utilities, and a reachable Docker socket are required. If
any real-data prerequisite is unavailable, the API returns an error or failed
experiment; it does not fabricate performance metrics or a `VERIFIED` verdict.

### Background Processing

Handled by `app/workers/`, run as separate async processes (not inside the request/response cycle):

* `telemetry_collector.py` — polls each connected customer database on a schedule (1–5 min).
* `retrain_worker.py` — retrains L1/L2 models and the RCA classifier when enough new labeled experiments exist.
* `canary_monitor.py` — watches an active canary deployment window and triggers rollback if thresholds are breached.
* `shadow_lab_worker.py` — provisions/tears down shadow DB containers for Feature 2 experiments.

### Authentication

FastAPI issues a JWT access token on login, set as an httpOnly, secure cookie. Every protected route depends on `get_current_user` (in `app/core/security.py`), which verifies the token and loads the user. Connected-database credentials are stored encrypted at rest in the application database (see §7) and are only decrypted server-side inside the collector/worker processes — never sent to the frontend.

### External Integrations

* **Customer PostgreSQL/Neon instance** — the only required external integration; connected via `asyncpg` using the connection string the user provides.
* **MLflow tracking server** — internal service (self-hosted via Docker), not third-party SaaS.
* No third-party LLM/model API is required to be paid; any locally-run or already-available LLM can sit behind the `app/agents/` LLM client interface.

### Real-Time Communication

* **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** from `GET /api/v1/experiments/{id}/canary/stream` and `GET /api/v1/forecasts/{id}/stream` — used only where the UI genuinely needs live updates (canary monitoring window, long-running shadow experiments). This is the single real-time mechanism used in the project; no WebSocket layer is introduced because nothing requires bidirectional client→server streaming.
* Everything else (dashboard lists, diagnosis reports, ROI numbers) uses plain REST + TanStack Query polling/refetch, which is sufficient and simpler.

### What each part does

* **`api/routes/`** — one file per feature area; each route function only validates input, calls a service, and returns the service's result. No business logic here.
* **`api/deps.py`** — shared FastAPI dependencies: `get_current_user`, `get_db_session`, `get_customer_connection`.
* **`core/config.py`** — loads and validates environment variables (Pydantic Settings).
* **`core/security.py`** — JWT creation/verification, password hashing, connection-string encryption/decryption.
* **`core/logging.py`** — structured logging setup used by every layer.
* **`models/`** — SQLAlchemy models for the **application database only**. Customer databases have no ORM models; they are accessed through raw introspection queries in `tools/pg_introspection.py`.
* **`schemas/`** — Pydantic request/response schemas, one-to-one with routes, used for OpenAPI generation and frontend type generation.
* **`services/`** — the orchestration layer: each service function implements one feature's end-to-end logic (e.g., `diagnosis_service.run_diagnosis()` pulls telemetry, invokes `agents/graph_diagnosis.py`, persists the result). Services are what routes call.
* **`agents/`** — LangGraph graph definitions, one per feature (diagnosis, simulation, forecast/closed-loop). `llm_client.py` is the single abstraction point for whichever LLM is configured, so agents never talk to a provider SDK directly.
* **`ml/`** — training and inference code for every model named in `TECHSTACK.md`. Each subfolder has `train.py`, `predict.py`, and `features.py`. Trained artifacts are versioned in MLflow, not committed to git.
* **`tools/`** — the only code allowed to touch a customer Postgres connection or execute SQL against it. `pg_introspection.py` is read-only. `hypopg_tool.py` creates/drops hypothetical indexes inside a transaction. `shadow_db_tool.py` clones/destroys shadow containers. `policy_engine.py` is the deterministic rule evaluator that gates canary deployment — it has no LLM involvement.
* **`workers/`** — long-running or scheduled background processes, started as separate containers/processes from the API (see §6).
* **`db/session.py`** — application DB engine (SQLAlchemy + asyncpg).
* **`db/customer_db.py`** — manages one connection pool per connected customer database, keyed by connection ID, with credentials decrypted just-in-time.
* **`migrations/`** — Alembic migrations for the application database schema only.

### Backend Request Flow

```text
API Route → Service → Agent/Business Logic → Tool → Database/External API → Response
```

Concretely, for a diagnosis request:

```text
POST /api/v1/connections/{id}/diagnose
  → diagnostics.py route
  → diagnosis_service.run_diagnosis(connection_id)
  → pulls recent evidence from app DB (already collected by telemetry_collector worker)
  → invokes agents/graph_diagnosis.py (LangGraph)
       → Planner / Concurrency / Vacuum / IO / Index agents call tools/pg_introspection.py
       → Supervisor agent reconciles → root-cause report
  → diagnosis_service persists report to app DB (models/diagnosis.py)
  → route returns schemas.DiagnosisReport
```

### Backend Layers

* **API layer** — HTTP contract only (validation, status codes, auth enforcement).
* **Authentication** — JWT verification, connection-credential encryption; lives in `core/security.py`, enforced via `api/deps.py`.
* **Business logic / Services** — the only layer allowed to coordinate multiple sub-systems (agents, ML, DB, tools) for one feature.
* **Agents** — LLM-driven reasoning over pre-computed evidence; never a source of truth for numbers.
* **ML** — deterministic-in-inference, trained offline; called synchronously by services or asynchronously by workers.
* **Tools** — the sole boundary to customer Postgres and to shadow databases; enforces read-only vs. approved-write access.
* **Database** — SQLAlchemy models/migrations for the app DB; raw asyncpg for customer DB introspection.
* **Workers** — background/scheduled processes, decoupled from the request cycle.
* **Configuration** — centralized in `core/config.py`, sourced from environment variables only.
* **Logging** — structured logs from every layer via `core/logging.py`; no separate logging service is introduced (out of scope for the hackathon build).

```

### What each part does

* **`app/`** — Next.js App Router pages. `(auth)/` holds login/signup, unauthenticated. `dashboard/` is the anomaly overview. `connections/` is the "Connect Database" flow described in the PRD workflow. `diagnostics/[connectionId]/` shows Feature 1's root-cause reports and evidence graph. `experiments/[experimentId]/` shows Feature 2's simulation results, skeptic findings, and live canary panel. `forecasts/[connectionId]/` shows Feature 3's forecast timeline, calibration, and bandit view. `roi/` shows Feature 4's dollar figures.
* **`components/ui/`** — presentational, feature-agnostic components.
* **`components/charts/`** — the evidence-graph (React Flow), calibration chart, and MAE-over-iterations chart, reused across feature pages.
* **`features/*`** — feature-scoped components + hooks that are not generic enough for `components/`, mirroring the four backend feature areas one-to-one.
* **`hooks/`** — cross-feature hooks (`useAuth`, `usePolling`, `useSSE`).
* **`lib/api-client.ts`** — a single typed `fetch` wrapper (base URL, auth header/cookie handling, error normalization); every `services/` module goes through this.
* **`lib/sse-client.ts`** — thin wrapper around `EventSource` for the two SSE endpoints (canary monitor, forecast stream).
* **`services/`** — one module per feature (`diagnosisService.ts`, `simulationService.ts`, `forecastService.ts`, `roiService.ts`), each exposing typed functions that call the backend routes in §4.
* **`stores/auth-store.ts`** — Zustand store holding the logged-in user; chosen as the single state-management library because it is minimal and sufficient — no Redux is introduced.
* **`types/`** — TypeScript types generated from the backend's OpenAPI schema, keeping frontend/backend contracts in sync without a shared package.
* Server state (telemetry lists, diagnosis reports, experiment results, forecasts) is managed by **TanStack Query**, not by a global store — it owns caching, refetching, and loading/error states for every API call.

### Frontend Flow

```text
Page (app/.../page.tsx)
  → Feature component (features/<feature>/...)
  → Hook (TanStack Query hook wrapping services/<feature>Service.ts)
  → api-client.ts (fetch) or sse-client.ts (EventSource)
  → Backend route
  → Response
  → TanStack Query cache update
  → UI re-render
```

Authentication: on login, the backend sets an httpOnly JWT cookie; `auth-store.ts` holds only the non-sensitive user profile fetched from `/api/v1/auth/me` on app load. Protected routes are guarded by a Next.js middleware that checks for the presence of a valid session (via a lightweight server-side call), redirecting to `/login` if absent.

Real-time updates: the canary-monitoring panel (Feature 2) and the active-forecast panel (Feature 3) subscribe via `sse-client.ts` to the backend's SSE endpoints; every other view uses TanStack Query polling/refetch-on-focus, which is sufficient for dashboard-style data.

---

## 6. Infrastructure Architecture

```text
infra/
├── docker/
│   ├── backend.Dockerfile
│   ├── frontend.Dockerfile
│   ├── worker.Dockerfile
│   └── shadow-db.Dockerfile
└── monitoring/
    ├── mlflow.env
    └── evidently.config.yaml
```

No Kubernetes and no Terraform are introduced — the project's scope (a hackathon-grade full-stack app with background workers and a self-hosted MLflow instance) is fully covered by Docker Compose. If production scaling is needed later, `infra/kubernetes/` can be added without changing anything in `apps/`.

* **`docker/backend.Dockerfile`** — builds the FastAPI app image; runs `uvicorn app.main:app`.
* **`docker/frontend.Dockerfile`** — builds the Next.js production image.
* **`docker/worker.Dockerfile`** — shared image for `telemetry_collector`, `retrain_worker`, `canary_monitor`, `shadow_lab_worker`; the specific worker to run is selected by a command/entrypoint argument, avoiding four near-duplicate images.
* **`docker/shadow-db.Dockerfile`** — plain Postgres image with the extensions the project needs (`pg_stat_statements`, `hypopg`) pre-installed; used by `shadow_lab_worker.py` to spin up ephemeral shadow databases per experiment.
* **`monitoring/mlflow.env`** — configuration for the self-hosted MLflow tracking server container (backing store = application Postgres, artifact store = local volume).
* **`monitoring/evidently.config.yaml`** — drift-check configuration consumed by `retrain_worker.py`.

### Deployment Architecture

```text
Internet
   ↓
Frontend (Next.js container)
   ↓  REST/SSE
Backend (FastAPI container)
   ↓                              ↘
Application Database (Postgres/Neon)   Customer Database (Postgres/Neon, user-provided)
   ↑
Workers (telemetry_collector, retrain_worker, canary_monitor, shadow_lab_worker)
   ↓
MLflow (tracking server container) + Shadow DB containers (ephemeral)
```

**Environment configuration:** each service reads its variables from the root `.env` (via `docker-compose.yml`'s `env_file`), never hardcoded.
**Networking:** all containers share a single Docker Compose network; only `frontend` and `backend` publish ports to the host/Internet; the application database, MLflow, and shadow DBs are internal-only.
**Secrets:** the JWT signing key and the customer-connection encryption key are supplied as environment variables (see §11), never committed; connection strings for customer databases are encrypted before being stored in the application database.
**Scaling:** out of scope for the hackathon build — a single instance of each service is assumed; the worker image is designed so any individual worker can be scaled independently later by running more containers from the same image with a different entrypoint argument.
**Monitoring:** MLflow covers model-level monitoring; Evidently covers data/prediction drift. No separate infra-level monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana) is included — marked `TBD` if needed post-hackathon.

---

## 7. Database Architecture

### Application Database (PostgreSQL/Neon)

This is the system's own database, hosted on Neon (or any Postgres). It stores:

* `users` — accounts, hashed passwords.
* `connections` — encrypted connection strings + metadata for each customer database the user has connected.
* `telemetry_*` — normalized evidence collected by `telemetry_collector.py` (query metrics, table metrics, plan metrics — as specified in the feature docs).
* `diagnoses` — Feature 1 root-cause reports and evidence graphs.
* `experiments` — Feature 2 optimization experiments (baseline/candidate metrics, statistical results, skeptic findings, verdicts).
* `forecasts` / `bandit_events` / `model_predictions` — Feature 3 forecasting and closed-loop learning records.
* `roi_records` — Feature 4 dollar-savings calculations.
* MLflow's own backing tables (tracking metadata) also live in this same Postgres instance, in a separate schema.

### Customer/Connected Database (PostgreSQL, any provider incl. Neon)

The database being monitored. The backend never assumes it is Neon — it only requires standard Postgres system views and, for Feature 2, the ability to install the `hypopg` extension and to be cloned into a shadow container. No ORM models exist for this database; access is exclusively through `app/tools/pg_introspection.py`, `hypopg_tool.py`, and `shadow_db_tool.py`.

### Database Access Layer

* Application DB: SQLAlchemy (async) models in `app/models/`, sessions from `app/db/session.py`, migrations via Alembic in `apps/backend/migrations/`.
* Customer DB: raw `asyncpg` queries in `app/tools/`, connection pools managed per-connection-id by `app/db/customer_db.py`, credentials decrypted just before use and never logged.

### Read/Write Boundaries

* Customer DB reads: unrestricted for the fixed set of system views/`EXPLAIN` used by Features 1 and 3.
* Customer DB writes: restricted to (a) HypoPG hypothetical index creation (session-local, never persisted), (b) the shadow clone (a separate database entirely), and (c) the single approved canary action (`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `ANALYZE`) — gated by `tools/policy_engine.py` and requiring prior user approval recorded in `experiments`.
* Application DB: standard read/write from services; workers write telemetry and experiment outcomes; no customer-facing code writes directly to it except through services.

### Database Security

* Customer connection strings encrypted at rest (Fernet/AES via `core/security.py`), decrypted only in-process.
* Application DB accessed only from backend/worker containers, never from the frontend.
* Customer DB roles: the connection the user supplies should be read-only for Features 1/3; the canary write path uses the same connection but only ever issues the two whitelisted, policy-approved statement types.

All agent code lives in `apps/backend/app/agents/`; every tool an agent can call lives in `apps/backend/app/tools/`; every model an agent consults lives in `apps/backend/app/ml/`. Agents are stateless per invocation — state (evidence, experiment history, bandit state) is always read from and written back to the application database, never held in agent memory across requests.

## 10. Communication Architecture

* **Frontend ↔ Backend:** REST over HTTPS (JSON), authenticated via an httpOnly JWT cookie; SSE for the two live-update endpoints (canary monitor, active forecast) described in §1 and §5.
* **Backend ↔ Application Database:** SQLAlchemy (async) over `asyncpg`, connection-pooled.
* **Backend ↔ Customer Database:** raw `asyncpg`, one pool per connection ID, managed by `app/db/customer_db.py`.
* **Backend ↔ Agents:** in-process function calls (LangGraph graphs are invoked directly from service functions in the same Python process — no separate agent service/queue is introduced, since nothing in the feature docs requires agents to run out-of-process).
* **Agents ↔ Tools:** in-process function calls, typed Python functions in `app/tools/`.
* **Backend ↔ External APIs:** only the customer's own Postgres endpoint and the self-hosted MLflow tracking server (internal HTTP).
* **Workers ↔ Backend:** workers and the API share the same codebase/database but run as separate processes/containers; they communicate only indirectly, through the application database (a worker writes a row, the API reads it on next request) — no message queue is introduced, since polling/scheduled workers are sufficient at this scale.
* **Services ↔ Services:** plain function calls within the backend process; `simulation_service` calls into `diagnosis_service`'s evidence only by reading the same application-database tables, not by direct cross-service calls.

infra/monitoring/mlflow.env
```

| Variable | Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | backend | Signs/verifies auth tokens |
| `CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | backend | Encrypts customer database connection strings at rest |
| `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` | backend, workers | Where models/experiments are logged |
| `TELEMETRY_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `telemetry_collector` worker | Polling frequency per connected database |

`docs/PRD.md` is marked `TBD` for file content since no standalone PRD document was provided as source material — the four feature specifications supplied so far serve as the PRD's content and should be consolidated into `docs/PRD.md` directly.
